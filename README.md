# ml-project-2-models
This is to demo a ML project where there are 2 different models sharing the same dataset 

# Business goal

A telecom company wants to:

Predict which customers are likely to churn (classification problem).

Estimate each customerâ€™s future lifetime value (LTV) (regression problem).

Both models use the same customer dataset, but train on different target variables.
